In the battle, we definitely want to have Each Pok√©mon has its own 6 basic natures: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense and Speed.  

First we want to see the overall distributions of 6 basic natures: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense and Speed. The plots are seen below.

It is seen that HP number over 100 can be seen as high.
