Pokémon, the abbrevation for Pocket Monster, is one of the best-known anime and game series in the world. We are keen on finding the designing data in Pokémon and visualize the hidden myth of Pokémon competions in order to become a true Pokemon Master in this turn-by-turn game. Therefore, we use [The Complete Pokemon Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon) and [Competitive Pokemon Analysis and Modelling](https://www.kaggle.com/code/n2cholas/competitive-pokemon-analysis-and-modelling)These two datasets includes data below :

- pokemons' index_ids and names 
- pokemons' nature, moves, abilities, items, etc
- pokemons' Tier of usage rate in the battles
